#### This project was based on Digital Inovation One class named "Integrando um Backend em Node.js com um Frontend em React para um E-commerce", 
#### A rating feature has been implemented, and now each comment that comes from an sqlite embedded on the backend test database also displays the user's rating about 
#### the e-commerce or its products, the next steps in order to improve this project are:
#### - getting the products info to be broughten by a http request from the backend(migration already includes the code to create the products table),
#### - finishing the darkmode to work inside the cards, cart, and labeled components
#### - moving and refactoring the function thats adds products to the  shopping cart
